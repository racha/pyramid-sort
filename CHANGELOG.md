# Changelog

## [0.4.2] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- **Scan report = Problems tab** — Workspace scan and the Problems tab now call the same function (`collectFindingsLikeProblemsTab` in `diagnostics.ts`). There is no separate scan-only logic, so the report cannot diverge from what the editor shows.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed

- **Scan / Sort All Files vs Problems tab** — Workspace scan now uses the **open editor text** when a file is already open (same as diagnostics), instead of always reading from disk, so unsaved buffers are not falsely reported.
- **Import local vs npm in monorepos** — Alias patterns are collected by walking **from each file’s directory up to the workspace root** (merging every `tsconfig.json` / `jsconfig.json` / Vite config found), not only from the workspace folder. Batch scan and the Problems tab now agree for nested packages (e.g. `apps/api/tsconfig.json` paths).
- **tsconfig / jsconfig watcher** — Any nested `**/tsconfig.json` or `**/jsconfig.json` change schedules a diagnostics refresh on open files.

### Added

- **Markdown reports** — Section titles and per-issue **line links** use `file://…` URLs (and `#L` line fragments) so you can open the file or jump near the line from the preview.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added

- **Scan All Files (Report)** command — walks the workspace (respects `pyramidSort.extensions`, root `.gitignore`, and skips `node_modules` / `dist` / etc.), runs the same diagnostics as the Problems tab (`showDiagnostics` + per-category `pyramidSort.diagnostics.*`), and opens a Markdown report.
- **Sort All Files** command — same walk; quick-pick to use **on-save category toggles** or **sort every category**; applies the shared sort pipeline per file and opens a Markdown summary of what changed. Uses workspace edits so undo works.
- **CLI** — `pyramid-sort <dir> --scan` (Markdown to stdout; `--out=<path>` optional; exit `1` if any findings), `pyramid-sort <dir> --sort-all` (`--check` dry-run, `--all-categories`, `--out=<path>`). Directory runs require `--scan` or `--sort-all`.
- **`.pyramidsortrc.json`** — optional `showDiagnostics`, `diagnostics`, and `sortImportsOnSave` / `sortAttributesOnSave` / `sortTypesOnSave` / `sortObjectsOnSave` / `sortCssOnSave` (defaults match VS Code) for batch CLI behavior.

### Changed

- **Shared `sortPipeline`** — extension on-save / full-document sort now delegates to `sortFileSource` so the CLI and VS Code stay aligned (including attribute regions via `sortAttributesInRange`).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added

- Full **multi-line support** across every sorter — objects, types/interfaces, CSS/SCSS, and JSX attributes. Values that span multiple lines (template literals, arrow-function bodies, nested objects, union types, CSS function values, etc.) are now treated as atomic blocks and never shredded.
- **Per-category diagnostic toggles** — `pyramidSort.diagnostics.{imports,attributes,types,objects,css}`. Defaults: imports and attributes **on**, types/objects/CSS **off**. Diagnostics are now independent of on-save sorting.
- **Selection-aware category commands** — `Sort Imports`, `Sort Attributes`, `Sort Types`, `Sort Objects`, `Sort CSS` now sort only the selection when there is one, otherwise the whole file.

### Fixed

- **Comment contents no longer corrupt sorter state.** Stray `{`, `}`, `"`, or `'` characters inside `//` or `/* */` comments used to break bracket matching and string tracking; the sorter now skips comments entirely when scanning.
- **Import diagnostic false positives.** Import order is now validated logically instead of by textual diff, so reflow, stable-sort ties, and blank-line normalization no longer trigger warnings on already-sorted files. Messages now pinpoint the exact offending line and why.

### Changed

- **On-save defaults** — imports and attributes on; types, objects, CSS off (unchanged, called out for clarity).

## [0.2.3] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **`pyramidSort.imports.groupExternalLocal`** (default `true`) — opt out of auto-grouping external (npm) vs local (relative / alias) imports. When `false`, imports are sorted purely by length in one block, no blank-line separator inserted.

### Changed

- **Clearer import diagnostic message** — now reads *“Imports are not in Pyramid Sort order (by length, with external/local groups)”* when grouping is on, so users aren’t misled when their imports are already sorted by length but the tool still wants to insert a group separator.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed

- **Default path aliases always apply** — `@/` and `~/` are now merged with aliases read from `tsconfig` / `jsconfig` / Vite. Previously, if the project defined *any* `paths` entry, the defaults were dropped, so imports like `@/env` could be misclassified as external npm packages, wrong sort order, and false “not sorted by length” diagnostics.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-16

### Changed

- **Marketplace description** — shorter, more casual blurb in `package.json`.
- **README** — before/after examples use generic names only (no Tailwind, product paths, or app-specific identifiers).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **Save Without Sorting** command — one-shot save that skips all on-save sorting.
- **Auto `maxLineWidth` for imports** when `pyramidSort.imports.maxLineWidth` is **0** (default): resolves from Prettier config files, then Prettier extension `printWidth`, then `editor.rulers`, then 80. Any **positive** value overrides.
- **`auto` sort direction** for imports, attributes, types, objects, and CSS — compares the opening/context line to the median body line length to pick ascending or descending.
- **`pyramidSort.objects.sortNestedObjects`** — optional sorting for `fn({ … })` and `prop: { … }` with block-aware ordering (multi-line nested objects stay intact).
- **`pyramidSort.extensions`** — file extensions (e.g. `.ts`, `.vue`) replace the old `pyramidSort.languages` language-ID list. Defaults include `.css` and `.scss`.

### Fixed

- **Import parser data loss** — imports with trailing comments (`// …`) no longer fall through to the multi-line parser, which previously consumed subsequent non-import code lines.
- **Attribute sorter data loss** — attributes sharing a line with the opening tag (`<div a="1"`) or closing bracket (`b="2">`) are no longer silently dropped.
- **Object/type/CSS block scrambling** — nested `{ }`, `[ ]`, and `( )` blocks are now kept intact instead of being sorted line-by-line; all three sorters use block-aware sorting.
- **Alias detection** — `tsconfig.json` / `jsconfig.json` with trailing commas no longer silently fails `JSON.parse`.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `pyramidSort.languages` renamed to **`pyramidSort.extensions`**; values are now extensions such as `.tsx` instead of VS Code language IDs.
